    <h3>A Vada Pav with green chilly</h3>
    <p>A really fantastic side dish or starter to serve with that Indian fakeaway!
        We love a crispy onion bhaji dipped in sweet chilli sauce.
        
        I find onion bhajis can be a little hit and miss when eating out. 
        Sometimes they can be a little greasy and flavourless. 
        But when they get it right? Oh yes!! That's when I eat too many 
        and can't fit in the main course.
        
        That perfectly crispy, slightly salty and mouth-wateringly spicy
         combo is what we're getting with this recipe.</p>
